People can sniff session cookies and hijack your session. This is a big problem.
We need to use security to protect our session cookies. 
We can use the `secure` flag to make sure that the session cookie is only sent over HTTPS. 
This will prevent people from sniffing our session cookies.
You also have cross site scripting attacks using javascript for example to 
steal the session cookie.
